To make the java code look nice, I _customized_ [pygments's `stata_light` style](https://pygments.org/styles/)
a bit. For this to work, you have to replace the original `stata_light.py` file with the one provided in this
repo. On my machine the original file was located in `~/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages/pygments/styles/`.

If you've done this, you can just run `latexmk main.tex`.
